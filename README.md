## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to employ computer vision techniques and data analysis to quantify deforestation in the Rondônia region of the Amazon forest, spanning just over a decade. This will involve utilizing NASA satellite images and applying techniques such as **[image processing], [mathematical morphology operators (erosion, dilation, closure, etc.)], and [convolution]**. The aim is to utilize these methods to accurately measure and understand the extent of deforestation in this specific region over the given timeframe.
